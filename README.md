## What is Graham Finance?
It's an app for my personal finances. It should keep track of all my costs and earnings. As well as all my investments.
- I need to add authorization and authentication so the app knows which information to display. 
- It should automatically read my emails and figure out when I receive or send money.
- It should also calculate how much money I really have spread across multiple bank accounts.
- Separate costs and earnings into categories so that I know where am I spending most of my money and where is most of my money coming from.
- Divide total income into basic necessities, luxuries and investments.
