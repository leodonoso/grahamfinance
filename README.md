# Graham Finance

A finance app made to help Venezuelan citizens make the most out of their money, by figuring out which finance app is best for receiving their money, where they should exchange it, where are they spending it, and more.

# Motivation
Graham is designed to help the Venezuelan citizens make the most out of their money. [Venezuela is a latinamerican country with a very particular economy.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/30/world/americas/venezuela-hyperinflation-100-bolivar-maduro.html)
Receiving paychecks without losing it all in commissions and hyperinflation is a big task that has turned most of the country's population into mathematicians. 

Graham started as a way for me, a Venezuelan citizen with a job that payed in USD, to see what was my best course of actions in order to keep most of my paycheck intact. [The economical crisis happening in Venezuela it's a very long story to tell](https://www.economicsobservatory.com/why-did-venezuelas-economy-collapse), but the TL;DR is that we don't actually use our own currency here, we actually just use US dollars, and there's a whole set of problems that come with that, like where do you receive them? How do you exchange them for Bolivares (VES)? What platform has the best exchange rate for you?. I created Graham to answer all of these questions for myself.

# Features (WIP)
